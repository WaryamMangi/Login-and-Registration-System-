This C++ project demonstrates a simple yet effective system for managing user authentication. It allows users to register by creating a unique username and password, stores the credentials securely in a file, and enables login by verifying the provided credentials. The system showcases basic concepts of file handling, conditional logic, and user interaction in C++.

Key Features
